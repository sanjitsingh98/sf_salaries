# sf_salaries
This repository contains a database Salaries.csv which I dowloaded from Kaggle. It contains salary data of people from San Francisco from 2011 to 2014. I have used pandas library functions to provide some insights into the data.
The output of the code can be found in the code_output file.

Based on the analysis done and results found, I have stated some insights below:
- The most number of jobs in San Francisco from 2011-14 is that of a Transit Operator and the average salary for this job role including benefits is approximately 84400.
- On an average, the people working in the public sector are paid much less in benefits,overtimepay and totalpay+benefits when compared with all other jobs. The benefits being received are declining every year whereas on for all other jobs they are increasing.
- On an average, the overtime pay received by the people working in police department is quite less than those in fire department.

The remaining in-depth numerical details are available in the output_code file. 

NOTE: There are no visualizations included in this analysis. Its solely done with pandas.
